# Class Projects
These are some of the projects I've done over the years that show the progress of my code quality. They haven't been changed from their original files.

The higher numbered classes generally have more interesting projects and should provide a better basis to judge my coding quality.

The class numbers correspond to the following:
cs241 - Data Structures
cs322 - Principles of Concurrent Programming
cs330 - Database Systems
cs367 - Computer Network I
cs460 - Operating Systems
